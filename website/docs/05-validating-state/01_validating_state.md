# Validating and Updating Deprecated APIs Before Upgrading

Checking for deprecated APIs and updating your manifests to use the latest API versions before upgrading your Kubernetes cluster is crucial for preventing compatibility issues, avoiding downtime, maintaining a secure and stable environment, easing maintenance, staying informed about Kubernetes changes, and ensuring compliance with best practices. Using tools like Pluto and kubectl convert streamlines the process of identifying and updating deprecated APIs, making it easier to maintain a healthy Kubernetes environment.

In this guide, we'll use Pluto and kubectl convert to identify and update deprecated APIs before upgrading.
